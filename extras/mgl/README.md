These are some [MiSTer MGL](https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/advanced/mgl/) files that allow you to split up multisystem cores into their own menu item and folders. This also has the side effect of allowing us to use their own GIF marquee.  These MGL files will match the GIFs used by the web2rgbmatrix.

Current Cores
-------
- SuperGrafx using the TG16 core

Install
-------

Copy the mgl files to the _Console and _Computer directories in /media/fat/.

Make directories with the same name in your MiSTer games/ and docs/ directories. ie games/GameGear/ & docs/GameGear/

Add your roms and manuals to these new directories.
