These are some [MiSTer MGL](https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/advanced/mgl/) files that allow you to split up multisystem cores into their own menu item and folders. This also has the side effect of allowing us to use their own GIF marquee.  These MGL files will match the GIFs used by the web2rgbmatrix.
